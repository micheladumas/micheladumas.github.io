    "text": "Hi there! I’m Michela.\n\n\n\nPhoto of Michela petting a cow in the Swiss Alps\n\n\nI’m an evolutionary ecologist with a particular interest for sexual selection. I aim to answer questions related to the evolution of sexual dimorphism in the wild using long-term individual-based datasets. I’m also broadly interested in the effects of climate change on wild populations.\nCurrently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Ottawa (Canada). I’m building on work I undertook during my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Julien Martin (M.A.D. Lab, University of Ottawa, Canada) and Dr. Pierre Bize (Bize Lab, Swiss Ornithological Institute - Vogelwarte Sempach, Switzerland).\nFor more information on my work, check out my projects.\nI spend most of my free time backpacking or otherwise enjoying the great outdoors. You’ll find a smattering of photos from some of my favourite adventures throughout this website!\n\nEducation\n[{{&lt; fa-graduation-cap &gt;}}] Ph.D. in Biology University of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. 2020-2024.\n[{{&lt; fa-graduation-cap &gt;}}] M.Sc. in Ethology Université Paris Sorbonne Nord, Ile-de-France, France. 2018-2020.\n[{{&lt; fa-graduation-cap &gt;}}] B.Sc. in Biology Honours, with speciallization in Ecology, Ecolution, and Behaviour, with a minor in Psychology. 2012-2017."
