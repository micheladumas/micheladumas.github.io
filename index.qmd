Hi there! I'm Michela. 

![Photo of Michela petting a cow in the Swiss Alps](/img/swiss-2.jpg "Encounter with a cow in the Swiss Alps")

I'm an evolutionary ecologist with a particular interest for sexual selection. I aim to answer questions related to the evolution of sexual dimorphism in the wild using long-term individual-based datasets. I'm also broadly interested in the effects of climate change on wild populations. 

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Ottawa (Canada). I'm building on work I undertook during my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Julien Martin (M.A.D. Lab, University of Ottawa, Canada) and Dr. Pierre Bize (Bize Lab, Swiss Ornithological Institute - Vogelwarte Sempach, Switzerland).

For more information on my work, check out [my projects](https://micheladumas.github.io/projects).

I spend most of my free time backpacking or otherwise enjoying the great outdoors. You'll find a smattering of photos from some of my favourite adventures throughout this website!
